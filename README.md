#  Reaction Diffusion
This project is based on Entagma's tutorial: https://entagma.com/houdini-true-3d-reaction-diffusion/
the tutorial teachs how to create a reaction diffusion simulation that results in beautiful generative models
I tried to create an interesting composition by simulating the reaction diffusion inside a torus
